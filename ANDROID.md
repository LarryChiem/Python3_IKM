# Android Setup (Capacitor)

This guide explains how to turn the web version of this project into a runnable Android app using Capacitor.

It bundles the built website files into an Android app (offline-capable) and runs them in a native WebView.
It does NOT depend on GitHub Pages at runtime.

## Prerequisites

Install:
- Node.js (LTS)
- npm
- Android Studio
- Android SDK (Android Studio will prompt)
- Java JDK 17 (Android Studio usually handles this)

---

## Project Layout Assumptions

```
Python3_IKM/
  web/
    dist/            # Vite build output
    public/
    src/
    android/         # Generated by Capacitor
```

All Capacitor commands are run from inside `web/`.

---

## 1) Install Capacitor

```bash
cd web
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
```

---

## 2) Initialize Capacitor

```bash
npx cap init
```

Use these values:

App name:
```
Python Practice Exam
```

App ID (important and permanent):
```
io.github.larrychiem.pythonpractice
```

Web directory:
```
dist
```

---

## 3) Build the Web App

```bash
npm run build
```

Verify:
```bash
ls dist/index.html
```

---

## 4) Add Android Platform

```bash
npx cap add android
```

This creates:
```
web/android/
```

---

## 5) Sync Web → Android

Every time the web app changes:

```bash
npx cap copy android
```

---

## 6) Open Android Studio

```bash
npx cap open android
```

---

## 7) Run on Physical Device

1. Enable Developer Options on phone
2. Enable USB Debugging
3. Plug phone into computer
4. Accept USB debugging prompt on phone
5. In Android Studio, select your device
6. Press Run ▶

---

## 8) Preparing for Play Store

### App Signing (required)

1. Android Studio → Build → Generate Signed Bundle / APK
2. Select Android App Bundle (AAB)
3. Create a new keystore (SAVE THIS FILE)
4. Choose release build
5. Generate bundle

Output:
```
app-release.aab
```

---

## 9) Play Store Upload

1. Create Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time)
2. Create new app
3. Upload AAB file
4. Fill in:
   - App description
   - Screenshots
   - App icon
   - Privacy policy
5. Submit for review

---

## Notes

- Capacitor bundles files locally (offline capable)
- localStorage works normally
- GitHub Pages is NOT used by the Android app
- Re-run `npm run build` + `npx cap sync android` + `npx cap copy android` before every release build

---

## Recommended Next Steps

- Add adaptive icons
- Add splash screen
- Enable offline caching via PWA service worker
